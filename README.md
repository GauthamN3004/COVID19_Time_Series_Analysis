### How it works
It fetches data from the John Hopkins Unversity github repository for COVID-19 cases and uses matplotlib to plot a moving graph of the increase in the number of cases and deaths.
It also plot a choropleth map to show the extent on COVID-19 in different countries(a choropleth map is a type of thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to a statistical variable that represents an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristic within each area).
